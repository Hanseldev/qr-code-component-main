## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this project, I learnt how to make my components responsive; that is the QR Code container and also applied some utility classes. Not much else was learned besides that.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<span class="nowrap">front-end</span>
```
```css
.card {
  height: auto;
}
```



### Continued development

I plan to continue building more layouts with flex and grid and applying responsive design principles
